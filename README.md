Robust Regressor is a powerful analytical tool built to deliver accurate regression estimates even when traditional assumptions are violated. Supporting robust methods like MM-estimation via the robustbase and MASS packages, the app allows users to analyze relationships between variables with confidenceâ€”handling categorical predictors, outliers, and heteroskedasticity with ease. Upload your dataset (CSV, Excel, or Stata), select your variables, and analyze your data, all within a user-friendly interface.
